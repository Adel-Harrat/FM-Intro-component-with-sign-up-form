## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- ReactJS
- TailwindCss

### What I learned

I didn't know how to do the shadow trick. It took me a few hours to figure it out, but I eventually managed to come up with a great and simple solution.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus more on Tailwind CSS.
